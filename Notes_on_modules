1. Current Modules
incident_response.py

Handles security incident response actions (block IP, block domain, quarantine file, isolate host).
Potential to integrate or orchestrate with existing case-management or forensic solutions.
siem_correlation.py

Correlates and analyzes security events.
Currently might be reworked or merged with a more general "log analysis" or "SIEM analysis" approach.
sigma_rules.py

Focused on Sigma rule-based detection.
Potentially merged into the SIEM correlation module to unify log-based detection logic.
threat_intel.py

Gathers and processes threat intelligence (IP, domain lookups, etc.).
Potentially integrates with external services like VirusTotal or MISP.
yara_scan.py

Scans files or memory dumps with YARA rules.
Could expand to handle additional scanning logic or tie into external sandboxing.
utils.py

Helper functions for logging, database interactions, API calls, and environment setup.
2. Proposed Adjustments & Rationales
a. Unify sigma_rules.py and siem_correlation.py
Why? Both handle log-based detection. Merging them into a single siem_analysis.py or log_analysis.py module simplifies the workflow:
Ingest logs (ELK, Splunk, or local text logs).
Apply Sigma rules for detection and correlation logic.
Output or escalate suspicious events.
b. Expand incident_response.py
Why? For a more robust IR workflow, consider:
Adding case tracking or tie-ins to external IR platforms (like TheHive or custom DB).
Possibly hooking into forensic scripts (e.g., capturing memory or triaging endpoints).
c. Refine threat_intel.py
Why? If using external threat intel services:
Implement API calls (e.g., VirusTotal, MISP, or OTX).
Normalize and store IOCs locally.
Provide automated lookups (IP, domain, hash).
d. yara_scan.py
Why? YARA scanning is essential for file-based or memory-based detection:
Offer a local or remote scanning mode.
Potentially tie in results with incident_response.py (e.g., quarantine if malicious).
3. Potential New Modules
malware_analysis.py

Goal: Deeper file/memory analysis.
Reasoning: Provide an interface for advanced or offline analysis steps (like hooking into a local sandbox or generating reports).
web_api_security.py

Goal: Testing web apps or APIs for vulnerabilities.
Reasoning: If PhantomWatch aims to do basic scanning or tie into open-source tools (like OWASP ZAP or Nikto).
network_monitor.py

Goal: Monitor network traffic for anomalies.
Reasoning: If PhantomWatch needs to tie into a network sensor or do basic intrusion detection logic.
4. Final Recommended Layout

modules/
│── __init__.py
│── incident_response.py
│── threat_intel.py
│── yara_scan.py
│── siem_analysis.py     # (Merged siem_correlation + sigma_rules)
│── utils.py
│── malware_analysis.py  # (New, if needed)
│── web_api_security.py  # (New, if needed)
│── network_monitor.py   # (New, if needed)
5. Why This Layout Works
Simplifies Log-Based Modules

Combining correlation logic (siem_correlation.py) with Sigma rule matching (sigma_rules.py) clarifies the pipeline.
Keeps IR, TI, and YARA Modules Focused

Each module is distinct:
incident_response.py → containment and remediation
threat_intel.py → pulling or querying external intel
yara_scan.py → scanning with YARA rules
Easily Expandable

New modules (malware_analysis.py, web_api_security.py, network_monitor.py) can be added as your scope grows.
Aligns with Real-World Workflows

Ties well into existing open-source or commercial solutions for each domain (IR, TI, YARA scanning, etc.).
Next Steps
Decide which expansions are highest priority (e.g., do you want to unify SIEM logic first, or add a new malware_analysis.py?).
Refactor existing code (like merging sigma_rules.py into siem_analysis.py) to unify detection logic.
Enhance incident_response.py with more robust tracking or hooking into external IR platforms.
By adopting these refinements, PhantomWatch can remain streamlined yet adaptable, matching real-world security workflows without unnecessary complexity.
